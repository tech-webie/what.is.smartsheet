# What is Smartsheet?

Smartsheet is an online project management solution that claims to be the modern alternative to traditional project management tools like Microsoft Project. Smartsheet focuses more on the collaborative aspects of project management, whereas traditional tools tend to focus more on schedules and tasks. That’s not to say that you can’t manage tasks and schedules in Smartsheet; you can. It means that collaboration functionality is baked into Smartsheet and is readily available to use with your schedules and tasks, whereas if you use Microsoft Project to manage a project, you have to use other means for collaboration.

Smartsheet is a web application, which means you don’t have to install any software on your computer to use it. Everything you need is online, and therefore you can access it from anywhere — work, home, or on the road on your smartphone or tablet


## What does Smartsheet do?

Smartsheet uses spreadsheets, referred to as sheets, as the basis of everything it does, but the difference between Smartsheet and spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets is that Smartsheet has all sorts of collaboration functionality incorporated into it.

**Beyond standard spreadsheet functionality, here’s what you can do with Smartsheet:**

Collaborate: You can invite other project team members to collaborate on a sheet, which means they can either view or edit the sheet.

* **Set up alerts:** You can set up notifications and reminders for tasks within the sheet.

* **Attach files:** You can attach files to the overall sheet or to a row (or task) in the sheet. The files are stored on Smartsheet’s servers and are vaccessible when you or collaborators log in to Smartsheet and view the sheet.

* **Have discussions:** You can set up discussions for the project as a whole or for certain tasks. These discussions are stored within the sheet.

* **Request updates:** You can request updates from collaborators on the progress of their assigned tasks from within the sheet.

* **Set up web forms:** This enables you to set up feedback or survey forms and have the responses users give to automatically populate into a sheet.

* **Publish the sheet:** You can make the sheet available via an external URL so that anyone can see it.
